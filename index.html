 fictional brand parodies, and the prominent framing of women's bare feet.Tarantino began his career 
as an independent filmmaker with the release of the crime film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. 
His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a dark comedy crime thriller, was a major success with critics
 and audiences winning numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Early life
Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the only child of Connie McHugh and aspiring actor Tony Tarantino, who left
 the family before his son's birth.[1][2] He is of Cherokee and Irish ancestry through his mother; his father is of Italian descent.[3][2] 
He was named in part after Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds's character in the TV series Gunsmoke.[4] Tarantino's mother met his father during a 
trip to Los Angeles. After a brief marriage and divorce, Connie left Los Angeles and moved to Knoxville, where her parents lived. In 1966, 
Tarantino returned with his mother to Los Angeles.Tarantino's mother married musician Curtis Zastoupil soon after arriving in Los Angeles, and 
the family moved to Torrance, a city in Los Angeles County's South Bay area.[7][8] Zastoupil accompanied Tarantino to numerous film screenings 
while his mother allowed him to see more mature movies, such as Carnal Knowledge (1971) and Deliverance (1972). After his mother divorced Zastoupil 
in 1973, and received a misdiagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, Tarantino was sent to live with his grandparents in Tennessee. He remained there less
 than a year before returning to California.At 14 years old, Tarantino wrote one of his earliest works, a screenplay called Captain Peachfuzz 
and the Anchovy Bandit, based on the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit. Tarantino later revealed that his mother had ridiculed his writing skills when 
he was younger; as a result, he vowed that he would never share his wealth with her.[11] As a 15 year-old, Tarantino was grounded by his mother for
 shoplifting Elmore Leonard's novel The Switch from Kmart. He was allowed to leave only to attend the Torrance Community Theater, where he participated
 in such plays as Two Plus Two Makes Sex and Romeo and Juliet.[9] The same year, he dropped out of Narbonne High School in Harbor City, Los Angeles.

Career
1980s: Early jobs and screenplaysThrough the 1980s, Tarantino had a number of jobs. After lying about his age, he worked as an usher at an adult
 movie theater in Torrance, called the Pussycat Theater. He spent time as a recruiter in the aerospace industry, and for five years he worked at Video Archives,
 a video store in Manhattan Beach, California.[14][15] He was well known in the local community for his film knowledge and video recommendations; Tarantino stated,
 "When people ask me if I went to film school, I tell them, 'No, I went to films."[16][a] In 1986, Tarantino was employed in his first Hollywood job, working with Video 
Archives colleague Roger Avary, as production assistants on Dolph Lundgren's exercise video, Maximum Potential.Before working at Video Archives, 
Tarantino co-wrote Love Birds In Bondage with Scott Magill. Tarantino would go on to produce and direct the short film. Magill committed suicide in 
1987, but not before destroying all footage that had been shot.[18] Later, Tarantino attended acting classes at the James Best Theatre Company, where he
 met several of his eventual collaborators for his next film.[19][20][b] In 1987, Tarantino co-wrote and directed, My Best Friend's Birthday (1987). It was 
left uncompleted, but some of its dialogue was included in True Romance.The following year, he played an Elvis impersonator
 in "Sophia's Wedding: Part 1", an episode in the fourth season of The Golden Girls, which was broadcast on November 19, 1988.Tarantino recalled that
 the pay he received for the part helped support him during the preproduction of Reservoir Dogs; he estimated he was initially paid about $650, however 
the episode was frequently rerun because it was on a "best of..." lineup, therefore received about $3,000 in residuals over three years.[25]</font></p>
